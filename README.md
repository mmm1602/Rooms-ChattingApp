 A small project for an instant messaging solution made using wpf and c#.
 
# Features
 - Add contacts.
 - Custom profile picture.
 - Custom username.
 - See date and time of messages.
 - Lan-based networking. (Can only connect to the server if the client is connected to the same network.)
 - Isolated server. (The server can be on a different computer than the client.)

# Planning to add
- Group chats.
- Voice messages.
- A database to store the user's info. (So that you don't have to input the Ip manually)
- A better interface for handling the server.
